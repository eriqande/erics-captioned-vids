5.0	10.0	The music is a little cheesy but you\ncan learn a lot from this video.
14.0	20.0	Expect to pause the video and rewind many times to take in the narration,\nponder the comments, and answer all questions (preceded by a Q with a number).
30.0	33.0	Q1: True or False. This animation is showing that each\nof the two "fragments" is a double-stranded segment of DNA.
33.0	35.0	I suspect that you really would have one color or type\nof adapter on the 3' and the other one on the 5' end.  So I wonder\nwhy the sides of purple and blue are not reversed.
35.0	36.5	Aha! Here that (possibly incorrect) symmetry is broken. Each end (either 3' or 5') now\n gets its own set of colors.
36.5	39.0	Q2: How does the sequence of the fragment on top compare\nto the sequence of the fragment on the bottom?
39.0	40.5	Q3: What is the purpose of the sequencing binding sites? Your answer\nshould include the words "oligonucleotide," "polymerase," "3'-hydroxyl," and "synthesize."
40.7	42.7	The indices are the "barcodes" used to identify which individual/plate the fragment is from.
43.0	44.5	These oligo-complementary regions let the fragment\nstick to the "lawn".
53.0	56.0	By "iso-thermally amplified?" they mean amplified at the same temperature.\nThis differs, thermally, from a traditional PCR amplification
56.0	60.0	Get ready! Understanding cluster\ngeneration is really where it is at!
60.0	63.0	Here is the lawn! The oligos are\nthe blades of grass on the lawn.
65.0	68.2	When they say "hybridization is enabled by the first of the two oligos"\nthey are referring to some magic that lets them make the oligos "sticky" or not...
70.0	73.5	We will name this fragment the "Original Template." You can\nthink of it as a piece of DNA from the critter you are sequencing.
73.5	76.2	NB: The Original Template is not always composed of DNA that was originally in the critter.\nIt might be a PCR copy of the critter's DNA.
78.0	81.0	Q4: Given the direction of travel of the polymerase, is the\nOriginal Template anchored to the lawn by its 3' or its 5' end?
85.0	88.0	Q5: How does the remaining strand relate to the Original Template?\nIs the remaining strand anchored by its 3' or 5' end?
88.2	92.2	Q6: Choose one from the parentheses: the purple part on the remaining strand is\n(the same as || complementary to) the purple lawn oligos. 
93.0	96.0	Q7: Choose one from each set of parentheses: the blue part of the remaining strand\nis at the (3'|5') end and is (the same as|complementary to) the blue oligos on the lawn. 
98.0	101.0	Q8: The polymerase grows the new daughter strand from 5' to 3'.  Does that accord with\nyour previous answers?  Make sure your answers are consistent with this.
105.0	109.0	Q9: Choose one: Every oligo, purple or blue, on the lawn is attached\nby its (5'|3') end.
109.0	113.0	Q10: Choose one: Every blue or purple sequence dangling at the unattached end of a\nstrand is at the (5'|3') end of the strand.
120.0	125.0	Just saying, knowing Q9 and Q10 is the key to understanding bridge amplification...
127.0	132.0	I don't like the terminology "reverse" strands... 
165.0 173.0 Is the growing sequence (TTAAGCGT) the sequence of the "Original Template" (as\ndefined above) or of its complement?
240.0	250.0	Q11: Is read 2 sequenced off the same strand as read 1?
